# clota

An [IOTA](https://iota.org) Client Library Implemented in Clojure

This library aims to be an idiomatic, feature-complete, FULL client implementation of the IOTA API Command Set.



## Usage

```bash
$ lein repl
> (clojiota.client/get-node-info)
> (clojiota.client/get-neighbors-activity)
> (clojiota.client/get-tips)
> ...
```
